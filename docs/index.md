## Welcome!

This site aims to be the resource for well experienced programmers who need to get up to speed with Java in the shortest time possible. It goes through all the things that are necessary to know, in roughly historical order, without labouring general programming matters that you probably already know. For example, it assumes prior knowledge of object oriented programming and will make no attempt to explain these concepts and techniques.
